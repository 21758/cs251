<h1>Objective</h1>

<p>In the final two-part series of assignments for the CS 251 course, we
will develop a solar system simulator.  The first part of this
assignment involves appliing several design patterns to implement a
simple version of the simulator, which will provide the foundation
that will integrate with the Android GUI in the second part of this
assignment.</p>

<p>This first part runs as a command-line application.  Since the second
part will run as an Android application you can only use Java 7
language features since Android doesn't support Java 8 (yet).</p>

<h1>Primary Participants</h1>

<p>This two-part series of assignments will implement the following set
of classes.</p>

<h2><code>Entity</code></h2>

<p>The <code>Entity</code> models any any object (such as the sun, planets and
moons) that is present in the solar system simulation.  <code>Entity</code>s have
the following properties:</p>

<ul>
<li>A name</li>
<li>A position</li>
<li>A mass</li>
<li>A velocity</li>
</ul>

<p>The second part of the assignment will have multiple types of objects
that must be handled in special ways.  For the first part, however,
only a single type of object is required.</p>

<p>In Part 1, <code>Entity</code> will also support an inverse <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_pattern">Memento
Pattern</a>.  The Memento
pattern provides a facility to record the <em>current</em> state of an object
to support rollback.  In this assignment, the Memento pattern will be
used to record changes that will be made to an instance of <code>Entity</code> in
the future.</p>

<p>An <code>Entity</code> will be able to accept <code>EntityVisitor</code>s, described below.</p>

<h2>Visitors</h2>

<p>This interface describe a simple version of the [Visitor
Pattern(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) for <code>Entity</code>
objects.  The first part of the assignment features the following two
concrete implementations of this interface:</p>

<ul>
<li>A <code>PrintVisitor</code> that prints an object to standard output.</li>
<li>A <code>StepSimulationVisitor</code> that calculates and stores a memento
used to update an <code>Entity</code> given a particular time step.  </li>
</ul>

<h2><code>Universe</code></h2>

<p>This object encapsulates the overall state of the simulation.  It
implements the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton</a> design
pattern.  <code>Universe</code> is responsible for maintaining a list of objects
present in the system, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Providing a way to add an object to the simulation,</li>
<li>Providing a way to remove objects from the simulation, and</li>
<li>Providing a way to
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iterator_pattern">iterate</a>
over all of the objects present in the simulation. This iterator will
implement an interface similar to Java 8 Spliterators (though we
won't use Java 8 features explicitly due to Android limitations)</li>
</ul>

<p><code>Universe</code> also provides a facility to advance the simulation by a
provided time increment via a method called <code>stepSimulation(double
seconds)</code>.  This method will implement the following pseudocode:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>For each <code>Entity</code> present in the system:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Calculate the force exerted on the <code>Entity</code> by every other <code>Entity</code> in
the system.</p></li>
<li><p>Use this force to calculate the change in velocity for the
<code>Entity</code>.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the position of the object based on its new velocity and the
requested time slice</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>For the first part of this assignment, you may assume that the <em>first</em>
<code>Entity</code> added to the system is the Sun and is immobile.</p>

<p>Since Java 7 lacks Spliterators, we will use the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adapter_pattern">Adapter
Pattern</a> to provide a
compatible interface built using normal Java Iterators.</p>

<h1>Provided Code</h1>

<p>We will provide skeletons that provide the interfaces for <code>Entity</code>,
<code>EntityVisitor</code>, and <code>Universe</code>.  We will also provide a library of
mathematical methods and types that will be used to represent and
perform calculations of <code>Entity</code> position and velocity.</p>

<p>This code will be made available in Dr. Schmidt's <a href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS251">Github repository</a>.</p>
