<p>In the final two-part series of assignments for the CS 251 course, we
will develop a solar system simulator.  The first part of this
assignment involves appliing several design patterns to implement a
simple version of the simulator, which will provide the foundation
that will integrate with the Android GUI in the second part of this
assignment.</p>

<p>This second part runs as an Android application.</p>

<h1>Primary Participants</h1>

<p>This two-part series of assignments will implement the following set
of classes.</p>

<h2><code>Entity</code></h2>

<p>In this assignment, <code>Entity</code> has become an interface.  This interface,
and the objects that implement it, are an implementation of the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Composite_pattern"><em>Composite</em></a> pattern,
as we will have a number of different types of objects that will be
represented. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Immobile Entities</strong>.  Such objects may be used to model
the sun and provide a fixed reference point in space around
which the other objects in the system orbit.  Such objects can
never have a velocity.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Entities</strong>. Such objects represent ordinary
objects, such as planets, moons, asteroids, or other
satellites.</li>
<li>Entities may also be <em>aggregated</em> into groups.  These
aggregates are intended to represent planets along with their
satellites.</li>
</ul>

<p>Each of these objects will be implemented by a separate class that
implements the Entity interface.</p>

<p>The stepsimulation behavior of <code>AggregateEntities</code> is configurable at
runtime. We do this with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern">Strategy
Pattern</a>.  We ask that
you implement two strategies: a 'Realistic' strategy, which moves each
member of the aggregate independently as if it were a regular simple
entity, and a 'Rigid' strategy, which moves the aggregate as if it
were a single object.</p>

<h2>Visitors</h2>

<p>This interface describe a simple version of the [Visitor
Pattern(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern) for objects that
implement the <code>Entity</code>.  The visitors in this assignment have
additional methods to handle the various object types.  In addition to
the <code>PrintVisitor</code> and <code>StepSimulationVisitor</code>, in this assignment you
will also need to implement a <code>DrawVisitor</code>, which will be used by the
<code>MainActivity</code> to draw entities to the screen.</p>

<h2><code>DrawProxy</code></h2>

<p>The <code>DrawProxy</code> is an implementation of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_pattern">Proxy
Pattern</a>.  This class
contains the logic necessary to draw Entities to the screen.  We have
provided most of the logic here.</p>

<h1>Graduate Students</h1>

<p>Graduate students are required to implement the stepSimulation to
support multiple threads.</p>

<h1>Provided Code</h1>

<p>We will provide pseudocode to calculate the position and velocity of
<code>AggregateEntity</code> objects.</p>
