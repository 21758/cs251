  <h4>Overview of the Downloaded Image Viewer Assignment</h4>

  <p>

    The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using
    Android to extend your assignment 3 solution by developing an app
    containing a main Activity that prompts the user for a URL to an
    image and then uses Intents, a DownloadImageService, and the
    Gallery Activity to download the image and view it via the Gallery
    app.  </p>

    <P>Undergraduate students can use the Android <A
    HREF="http://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/IntentService.html">IntentService</a>
    to implement the DownloadImageService, which is covered in <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9tx9sRmn48&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=39">this
    video</a>. <P>

    <p> Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for
    graduate credit) <EM>must</EM> implement the DownloadImageService
    via an Android <A
    HREF="http://developer.android.com/guide/components/bound-services.html">bound
    Service</A>, which is covered in <A

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for the ugrad version of this assignment is
    available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS251/tree/master/assignments/assignment4-ugrad">here</a>.
    Likewise, skeleton code for the grad version of this assignment is
    available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS251/tree/master/assignments/assignment4-grad">here</a>.
    Use your <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account to
    pull the appropriate skeleton code in your repository, read it
    carefully, and complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <p> Note that there are no automated unit tests for this
  assignment. Instead, you'll know the program is working when you can
  successfully download and view an image.

  <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
  <p>

  This assignment is designed to further your understanding with
  programming Android in Java.  It's somewhat harder than the first
  Android assignment since it involves background processing with an
  Android Service. Therefore, start early and come to office hours of
  you have questions or run into problems.  </p>
