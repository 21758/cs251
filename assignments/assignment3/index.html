  <h4>Overview of the Downloaded Image Viewer Assignment</h4>

  <p>

    The purpose of this assignment is to give you experience using
    Android to develop an app that contains a main Activity that
    prompts the user for a URL to an image and then uses Intents and
    other Activities to download the image and view it via the Gallery
    app.  </p>

    <p> Graduate students (or students who are taking this course for
    graduate credit) <EM>must</EM> implement the onCreate() method in
    the DownloadImageActivity class to use the Android AsyncTask
    framework, which is covered in <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQJnejqcAZw">this video</a>. <P>

    Undergraduate students are welcome use the AsyncTask framework to
    implement this method, but may choose to use the Android "HaMeR"
    framework instead, which is covered in <A
    HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cV54pxU6bc&list=PLZ9NgFYEMxp4tbiFYip6tDNIEBRUDyPQK&index=28">this
    video</a>. <P>

  <h4>Skeleton Code</h4>

  <p> Skeleton code for both the grad and ugrad versions of this
    assignment is available <a
    href="https://github.com/douglascraigschmidt/CS251/tree/master/assignments/assignment3/">here</a>
    account.  Once you've setup your <a
    href="https://about.gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> account you can pull
    this skeleton code in your repository, read it carefully, and
    complete the "TODO" markers.  </p>

  <p> Note that there are no automated unit tests for this
  assignment. Instead, you'll know the program is working when you can
  successfully download and view an image.

  <h4>Concluding Remarks</h4>
  <p>

  This assignment is designed to help you get familiar with
    programming Android in Java.  However, it is harder than the first
    two Java Array assignments since it involves many more "moving
    parts", so make sure you start early and come to office hours of
    you have questions or run into problems.  </p>
